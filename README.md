# DeathSwap
This is a plugin for a private Minecraft server to play a gamemode known as DeathSwap.

A timer is run on the server, and once every set amount of time, the 2 competitors are swapped positions. Players are encouraged to make traps to try and kill their opponent, and the last man alive wins.

This plugin was quickly coded for a friend in my free time, and will be tidied up / configuration support will be added if I make the decision to release to the public.
